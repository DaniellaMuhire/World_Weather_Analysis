# World_Weather_Analysis
## Project Overview
Task: Collect and analyze weather data across cities worldwide.
Purpose: a travel technology company will use the data to recommend ideal hotels based on clients' weather preferences.
Method: Create a Pandas DataFrame with 500 or more of the world's unique cities and their weather data in real time. This process will entail collecting, analyzing, and visualizing the data.
## Results
1. Generated a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieved the nearest city, and performed an API call with the OpenWeatherMap. Retrieved the current weather description for each city then, created a new DataFrame containing the updated weather data.

2. Used input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences, then used those preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Then, show those destinations on a marker layer map with pop-up markers.

3. Used the Google Directions API to create a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities chosen from the customerâ€™s possible travel destinations. Then, created a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city on the itinerary.
